# Conky_Project

I'll be using my own modified Conky Config file which is a transparent sidebar style with Graphs and Bars as a template. 
Using that template for layout, I'll convert Wesley Brewers MintyConky config (specifically uses overhead modules) to transparent
sidebar style.  I've only modified Wesleys config on the "Health" pane, changing from hwmon for temp and fan control to nvidia-smi
and lm-sensors for GPU recognition and temp readings and CPU Temps.
